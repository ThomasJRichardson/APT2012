        <strong>Wind Up of the Ryanair Retirement and Death Benefits Plan (“the Plan”)</strong></h2>
    <h2>
        Why did the Trustees resolve to wind up the Ryanair Retirement and Death Benefits Plan?</h2>
    <p>
        Ryanair (Principal Employer) gave notice that it was ceasing to voluntarily contribute to the Plan with effect from 30 December 2013. After careful consideration, taking legal and actuarial advice, the decision was taken by the Trustee to wind up the Plan with effect from 30 December 2013.</p>
    <h2>
        What happens during a wind-up process?</h2>
    <p>
        Once the decision is made to wind up the Plan, the Trustee then needs to review the investments of the Plan and to disinvest assets (this aspect is complete) and then start the process of gathering all member data and their benefit details. This will allow them to then determine the overall funding position of the Plan and determine how much is payable to members. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You will shortly be contacted to confirm the data held for you under the Plan. Once any data queries are resolved then all members’ benefits will be finalised and the process of communicating members’ options will start. 
    </p>
    <h2>
        How long will the process take?</h2>
    <p>
        The process is likely to take at least 2 to 3 months depending on the level of queries and data changes that arise. 
    </p>
    <h2>
        What will this mean for active members, deferred members and pensioners?</h2>
    <p>
        Active members, or current employees who are members of the Plan, will not earn any more benefits under the Plan after 30 December 2013 and will become deferred members from that date. Deferred/Preserved pension entitlements will be calculated for each member. This pension is based on the pension formula as set out under the rules of the Plan and uses your final pensionable salary as at 30 December 2013 and your pensionable service up to that date.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you had already left the Plan and are a deferred member then your deferred pension has already been calculated and advised to you and is based on the service you completed to your exit date and your final pensionable salary at that date. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Members who were in receipt of a pension from the Plan at 30 December 2013 will continue to receive their pension each month. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Each member’s status is frozen as at the date of wind up, i.e. at 30 December 2013. This means that a member reaching normal retirement age after 30 December 2013 will not become a pensioner of the Plan and will not receive an immediate pension. These members will be with in due course as to their options and benefits under the Plan and will include retirement options. 
    </p>
    <h2>
        Will current pensions continue to be paid as normal?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Members who were in receipt of a pension from the Plan at 30 December 2013 will continue to receive their pension each month. 
        </p>
        <h2>
            If a member is due to retire during the wind-up process can they access their pension
            benefit?</h2>
        <p>
            Each member’s status is frozen as at the date of wind up, i.e. at 30 December 2013. This means that a member reaching normal retirement age after 30 December 2013 will not become a pensioner of the Plan and will not receive an immediate pension. It will not be possible to access pension benefits straight away. These members will be communicated with in due course as to their options and benefits under the Plan and this will include retirement options. 
        </p>
        <h2>
            If a pensioner dies during the wind-up process is the spouse’s pension payable?</h2>
        <p>
            If a pensioner dies during the wind up process a spouse’s pension is payable in accordance with the normal scheme rules and the benefits applying to the member on retirement.</p>
        <h2>
            What happens if there is a death-in-service case?</h2>
        <p>
            Death in service benefits are no longer provided under the Plan once it goes into wind up. The Trustee understands that Ryanair has put alternative death in service cover in place for current employees. If any active or deferred member of the Plan dies after 30 December 2013, the amount due to them as part of the wind up will still be payable to their estate and details of this will be communicated in due course when options are communicated to all members.</p>
        <h2>
            If a member is entitled to a Refund of Contributions – will this be paid out during
            the wind up process?</h2>
        <p>
            Members entitled to a refund of contributions will be advised of this option when all members are communicated their options on wind up. It will not be possible to avail of this sooner. 
        </p>
        <h2>
            Can members still access 30% of their AVCs during wind up process?</h2>
        <p>
            Yes, this option is still open to members. If you are interested in pursuing this
            option please contact the administrator.
        </p>
        <h2>
            How are the benefits met on wind up?</h2>
        <p>
            The Pensions Act 1990 (as amended) sets out the priority of benefits on wind up,
            or the order of who should receive benefits first and how they are calculated. In
            broad terms benefits are paid in the following order:</p>
        <p>
            1. Pensions in payment. For members who are already retired at the wind up date, their current pension (p.a.) is secured by annuity purchase. This means that pensions will be bought out with an insurance company</p>
        <p>
            2. Preserved pensions for active and deferred members. These are paid for (active and deferred) members in the form of a transfer value, calculated in accordance with the Minimum Funding Standard (MFS). The calculation of the MFS transfer value is prescribed and no discretion rests with the Plan actuary or the trustees in the calculation of this figure for each active and deferred member.</p>
        <h2>
            What can the Plan afford to pay?</h2>
        <p>
            It is estimated based on current data available that the Plan will be in a position
            to meet the following benefits:</p>
        <p>
            100% of pensions by annuity purchase for current pensioners,
            </p><p>
            110% MFS transfer values for active and deferred members.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reason the amounts above are unknown is that the next step of the wind up is to reconfirm and verify all member data and beneficiaries under the Plan. This may lead to some changes in liability and therefore it is impossible at this stage to put an exact number on this percentage. When options are communicated in more detail to members, the numbers above will be confirmed. 
        </p>
        <h2>
            Members should note however, that the above is only an estimate and is in no way
            guaranteed.
        </h2>
        <h2>
            What is a transfer value?</h2>
        <p>
            A transfer value is the present day value of your future deferred benefit from the
            Plan as determined under the MFS using a basis specified by the Society of Actuaries
            in Ireland and approved by the Minister for Social Protection.
        </p>
        <h2>
            When will members receive their AVCs?</h2>
        <p>
            AVCs will be payable at the time transfer values are paid out to members and details
            of your AVC holdings will be communicated to you at this time. Please note that
            you are not able to continue making AVCs to the Plan after the wind up date, however,
            you are still entitled to direct how your AVCs should be invested during the wind
            up process. If you wish to review or change your AVC investment fund choice please
            contact the administrator.
        </p>
        <h2>
            What about future pension provisions for employees?</h2>
        <p>
            All members cease to accrue any benefits under the Plan once a wind up is triggered so for all current employees of  Ryanair who are members of the Plan, pensionable service will cease on 30 December 2013.  Active employees are being offered membership of the Ryanair defined contribution pension plan.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Where can I get information?</h2>
        <p>
            The administrator will be issuing further communication to you regarding your rights and entitlements under the Plan in due course. I would note however, that the wind up of a Plan of this size can take some time. Please be patient. The administrator will not in a position to provide you with any details of your likely transfer value for some months to come and individual member figures and options will not be available until most likely, March 2014. The first step will be to verify all member data and records and you can expect to hear further on this in the coming weeks.
