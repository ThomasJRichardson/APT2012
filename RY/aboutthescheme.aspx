        What’s happening?</h2>
    <p>
        The Trustee resolved to wind up the Plan (effective from 30 December 2013), following notification from the Principal Employer of its decision to cease sponsorship of the Plan. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In reaching this decision, the Trustee took independent legal and professional advice on the matter, taking into account the need to act in the best interests of all the beneficiaries of the Plan. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The Plan had an estimated deficit of €9.7m at the end of December 2013. Following negotiations with the Trustee the company has agreed to fully fund this deficit of €9.7m and pay an additional €2.8m into the Plan to enable the existing active and deferred members to receive enhanced transfer values.
    <p>
        As there are sufficient assets to meet all of the obligations under the terms of the Pensions Act as amended, the priority order in which the assets of the Plan are disbursed is as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
    1)	The pensions in the course of payment will rank as a priority,
    </p>
    <p>
    2)	The interests of active and deferred members ranking equally thereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result of the funding level of the Plan; after the payment of the deficit of €9.2m and the additional contribution of €2.8m, it is quite likely that the transfer values for active and deferred members will be approximately 110% of that required  under the Pensions Board Minimum Funding Standard (MFS). 
    </p>
    <p>
        The Trustee will secure the pensions in payment through annuity purchase. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are an active or deferred member at 30 December 2013, your entitlement will be calculated by the plan actuary based on your pensionable service completed up to 30 December 2013, or earlier date of leaving, and adjusted upwards to reflect the solvency level of the Plan following the payment of the additional contributions.
