        What’s happening?</h2>
    <p>
        The Trustees resolved to wind up the plan (effective from 31 May 2013), following
        notification from the Principal Employer of its decision to cease sponsorship of
        the plan.
    </p>
    <p>
        In reaching this decision, the Trustees took independent legal and professional
        advice on the matter, taking into account the need to act in the best interests
        of all the beneficiaries of the plan.
    </p>
    <p>
        The assets of the plan (circa €230m) on 31 May 2013 were insufficient to meet the
        liabilities of the plan (circa €280m) under the Minimum Funding Standard (MFS).
        <span style="color: #000;">[Please refer to "What can the Plan afford to pay?" in the
            <a href="faqs.html">FAQ's</a> section]</span></p>
    <p>
        As there are insufficient assets to meet all of the obligations, the terms of the
        Pensions Act as amended, specify the priority order in which the assets of the scheme
        are disbursed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Under the Act, the pensions in the course of payment (excluding any entitlement
        to pension increases) will rank as a priority with the interests of active and deferred
        members (excluding any pension increase entitlements) ranking equally thereafter.
        Given the current funding level of the scheme it is quite likely that the accrued
        benefits of active and deferred members (excluding any entitlement to increases
        to pensions once in payment) will not be fully covered under the MFS.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Trustees will secure the pensions in payment (exclusive of annual increases)
        through annuity purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are an active or deferred member at 31 May 2013, your entitlement will be
        calculated by the scheme actuary based on your pensionable service completed up
        to 31 May 2013, or earlier date of leaving, and adjusted to reflect the solvency
        level of the plan, (based on the remaining once the pension liabilities have been
        secured by annuities.</p>
